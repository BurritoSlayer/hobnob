sms:

- need twilio webhook to send post request of incoming message to ec2 instance
- ec2 will store these in the same dynamodb table the posted texts are
  (will use POST /receivetexts)
- syncing texts on the client will involve taking a snapshot of the latest 10? texts
- after taking the snapshot, display these texts when the load texts function is called

two options for syncing incoming texts from the dynamodb to the client:

- server will store current client ips that are actively requesting to sync texts
- when new text is added from twilio webhook, also send the text to client from ec2 webhook

    or
    
- client will request to get the latest texts every ~3 seconds or so?
- (time variable should be parameterized, so can be easily changed, possibly even through user configuration)
